A port for a Pylontech US3000 Master with US2000 Slave.
There were some data fields i did not understand under USER1, and USER2
I think it has to do with either Errors or with the Battery Group
All the Dip's on the Batteries are in the OFF possition as i only have on Battery Bank
Console is connected to the top via USB to RS232
Uplink Cable is from Master(us3000) port 2, to Slave (us2000)
